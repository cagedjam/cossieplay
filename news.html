		Party Guidelines
	</div>
	<p>
		CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard. Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge. Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.
